The business problem tackled here is trying to improve customer service for YourCabs.com, a cab company in Bangalore.
The problem of interest is booking cancellations by the company due to the unavailability of a car. The challenge is that cancellations can occur very close to the trip start time, thereby causing passengers inconvenience.
The goal of the competition is to create a predictive model for classifying new bookings as to whether they will eventually get canceled due to car unavailability.
